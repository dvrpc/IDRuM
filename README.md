# IDRuM
DVRPC in partnership with PennDOT District 6, has developed the web-based Interactive Detour Route Mapping (IDRuM) application. It organizes all existing PennDOT Emergency Detour Routes within the Southeastern Pennsylvania region into a manageable, easy-to-use interface. DVRPC has worked with PennDOT District 6 to update and reformat the detour route maps for all limited access highways within the region, replacing outdated paper maps with digital PDF maps. IDRuM compiles the PDF detour maps into a simple, "point-and-click" application. The detour route PDFs can be used by first responders, planners, and/or anyone who is in need of DOT-approved detour route plans.
